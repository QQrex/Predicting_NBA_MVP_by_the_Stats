# Predicting_NBA_by_the_Stats

## Background

Starting from the NBA 1955-56 regular season, one player is choosen to win the Maurice Podoloff Trophy or more commonly known as the Most Valuable Player or MVP award. Over the years the winner of this reward has be choosen through voting from NBA player votes, sportswriters, broadcasters and even fans votes. With that said, every year the debate for who should be the MVP has been contentious (except for the Stephen Curry who was crown the unanimous MVP in 2015-16). However, based purely on the season stats of a player, could we predict the results of the MVP race? Or is there some magic a MVP winner does that doesn't show up on the stats sheet that truely makes them the MVP?

## Purpose

Training a machine learning model to predict the NBA season MVP based on season box scores.
